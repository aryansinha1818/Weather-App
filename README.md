# Weather-App
Developed a dynamic weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with seamless integration of the RapidAPI platform. The app allows users to search for weather information of any location and provides real-time updates. Leveraging the RapidAPI's weather API, the app retrieves accurate and up-to-date weather data, enhancing the user's experience.
